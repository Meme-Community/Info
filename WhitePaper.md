## **Gameplay Mechanism Overview**

Meme Community is driven by user-submitted token gameplay proposals. In each phase, the community selects a meme token gameplay from the proposals, which then drives the launch of a new token. Users who adhere to the rules of the current phase’s gameplay will be elected to the Proposal Group and can contribute to the next phase’s gameplay proposal.

### **Advantages of Joining the Proposal Group**:

- Access to exclusive, real-time updates.
- A chance to turn your meme dreams into reality.

### **Phase 1 Gameplay**

- **Token**: $MeC

- Mechanism

  : After purchasing $MeC tokens, users must airdrop 5% of their initial purchase to ten influential addresses.
